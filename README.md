**Topic**: Predictive Analysis on E-Commerce Reviews recommendations with Sentiment Classification using Deep Learning Techniques 

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis model for e-commerce reviews using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This project aims to classify customer reviews' sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

**Dataset**:

  The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews from Kaggle. It contains 568,000 reviews with 10 features including review text, ratings, helpful votes, product ID, and user ID.

**Features**:

Review Text: The actual text of the review.
Rating: The rating given by the user (1-5 stars).
Helpful Votes: Number of helpful votes the review received.
Product ID: Identifier for the reviewed product.
User ID: Identifier for the user who wrote the review.
Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicates and handling missing values.
Text Normalization: Conversion to lowercase, punctuation removal, and expansion of contractions.
Tokenization: Splitting of text into individual tokens (words).
Stop Words Removal: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
Lemmatization: Reduction of words to their base or root form.
Model Development
The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, effectively capturing sequential dependencies in text data.

**Architecture**:

Input Layer: Accepts tokenized and vectorized text data.
LSTM Layers: One or more LSTM layers to process sequential data.
Dense Layer: Fully connected layer with softmax activation for classification.
Hyperparameters
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 10-20
Dropout Rate: 0.2-0.5

**Training and Evaluation**:

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

**Results**:

The model's performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves to ensure robust classification.

**Future Scope**:

Advanced Models: Exploration of sophisticated architectures like BERT or Transformer-based models.
Multilingual Support: Extension to handle reviews in multiple languages.
Real-Time Monitoring: Implementation of systems for continuous learning and adaptation.
Enhanced Personalization: Integration with recommendation systems for personalized suggestions.
Cross-Domain Applications: Application in social media monitoring, customer service, and market research.
